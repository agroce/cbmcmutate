Popper basically rejects induction, in the sense of drawing general conclusions of truth from particulars.  This corresponds to a rejection of one view of testing, as demonstrating that a program works.  Dijkstra meant his "can only show errors" as criticism, but Popper implies this is precisely testing's value, in any context not purely deductive: that is, any context where we are either unable to prove fully that a program satisfies its specification (the usual case) or where we are able to do so, but unsure we really have a complete and perfect specification.

The novel assumption over Popper of mutation analysis is simply that a truer specification likely constrains the programs satisfying it more than another.  Replace truer with simply "more scientific" and Popper would likely agree.
