It is not surprising that there should be a correspondence between the ideas of Popper and the effort to verify and test software systems.  Popper is clear that his approach is meant as an answer to all the fundamental problems of epistemology.  Even such highly practical popular guides to software testing as the well-known book of Kaner, Bach, and Pettichord \cite{kaner} argue that software testing is essentially an epistemological discipline.
